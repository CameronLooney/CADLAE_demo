		# PCA Localisation ðŸ“Œ

		### What is PCA Localisation?
		Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that transforms a dataset into a new
		coordinate system where the data is represented by a set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal
		components. The principal components are ordered in terms of their contribution to the variance in the data.
		
		### How does it work?
		PCA can be used for anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems by analyzing the reconstruction error
		from the test predictions of our proposed. The reconstruction error can be used to identify anomalous
		samples, and performing PCA on the reconstruction error allows us to identify the features that contributed
		the most to the anomaly. This information can be used to diagnose the cause of the anomaly and
		potentially take corrective action.
