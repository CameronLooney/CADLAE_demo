		# Threshold Localisation ðŸ“Œ

		### What is Threshold Localisation?
		This section discusses how to use reconstruction error for each feature in time series data from an
		industrial control system to localize the cause of an anomaly. The process involves comparing the
		reconstruction error for each feature in the anomalous data to the maximum reconstruction error for that
		feature on the normal operation data.
		
		### How does it work?
		By setting a threshold value for each feature and identifying the features with the most time steps above
		the threshold, we can determine the features that are likely causing or closely related to the anomaly.
