		# Correlation Subgraph
		
		### What is a correlation subgraph?
		Here we describe how a correlation graph can be generated to localise the cause of an anomaly in a cyber physical system.
		To create this graph, we use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, which is a non-parametric measure of correlation based
		on the ranks of the data. This coefficient is robust to non-normality and can handle both ordinal and continuous variables,
		making it suitable for use in a cyber physical system where data may not always be normally distributed.
		
		### How does it work?
		The correlation coefficient is calculated between all pairs of features in the system, and if the absolute value of their correlation coefficient
		is above a user-defined threshold, we create an edge between them in the correlation graph. This threshold is implemented
		to ensure disconnected subgraphs are generated. The resulting graph will consist of a set of disconnected
		subgraphs, where each subgraph is a group of features that are highly correlated with each other.
		These subgraphs can then be used to localise the cause of the anomaly.
